            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    This hearty chicken dish makes the perfect dinner! It combines the sweet tanginess of balsamic
                    glaze with the rich umami flavors of mushrooms. It is also convenient to make, and can be stored,
                    adding to its versatility. It is keto-approved, and is suitable for those with diet sensitivities.
                    The high protein content of this dish is also an added bonus!

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sauce by adding balsamic vinegar, coconut aminos, monk fruit, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a 
                        pinch of pepper to a small bowl or measuring cup. Whisk well to combine. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour olive oil to a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add onions, thyme, and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes 
                        until fragrant.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add chicken to the pan and cook on each side for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, add chicken, celery, mayo, brown mustard, and salt. Toss until chicken is fully coated 
                        and ingredients are well-combined.

                    <li>Pour in sauce and reduce heat to low-medium.  Add butter and let simmer for 10-15 minutes until sauce has
